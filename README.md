# Awesome Machine Learning APIs

📸 A collective list of ML APIs for use in software or web development. 🤖🤖🤖
💥 List contains 100+ ML APIs covering topics like computer vision, language processing, natural language processing, speech synthesis, face detection, and more (see below for the full list). All of these APIs are free to use and have a clear and easy to read documentation. We hope this list will become a great reference for people who are into ML or just want to play around with it.

A public API for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/imagezero/Awesome_ML_APIs)!

Please note a passing build status indicates all listed APIs are available since the last update. A failing build status indicates that 1 or more services may be unavailable at the moment.


This helps developers learn about the many APIs out there using this collective list of Machine Learning (ML) APIs broken down into categories and ranked by their popularity. Rarely a week goes by that we don't get an email from someone asking about machine learning APIs. You know the type: the one with the bright eyed copy-paste-friendly description of how these things shall change your life forever and streamline your data science workflow until you're swimming in corporate dollars and leisure time.
